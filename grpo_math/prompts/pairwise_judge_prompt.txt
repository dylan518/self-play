You are a strict math judge comparing two candidate solutions to the same question.

Judge which solution is better using correctness first, then reasoning quality.
You must choose exactly one winner: A or B.
Do not output TIE.

Rules:
1) If exactly one solution provides an explicit final integer answer, prefer that one.
2) If both provide final answers and they differ, prefer the answer supported by more coherent and internally consistent reasoning.
3) If neither provides a clear final answer, prefer the one with clearer, less self-contradictory reasoning.
4) Prefer concise, checkable reasoning over verbose but vague text.

Question:
{question}

Solution A:
{answer_a}

Solution B:
{answer_b}

Output exactly one line:
PREFERENCE: A
or
PREFERENCE: B
