Generate one original, difficult math problem that is clear, self-contained, solvable, and objectively verifiable.
Prefer non-routine, multi-step problems (algebra, number theory, combinatorics, or geometry), but keep the final result a single integer.
The question must have exactly one finite, unambiguous integer final answer that can be checked mechanically.
Do not generate tasks with multiple valid answers, infinite solution sets, or undefined quantities.
Do not ask for "sum of all elements" unless the set is explicitly finite by construction.
Avoid open-ended proofs, ambiguous wording, and tasks requiring long casework with unclear conventions.
The goal is to produce difficult-but-verifiable questions where candidate solutions may disagree in quality.
Do NOT provide the solution, answer, hints, or intermediate steps.

Output exactly one line:
